        <h3>Let's Cook It!</h3>
        <h4>Soup:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice up onions, carrots and celery (probably half an onion for a smaller batch and a whole 
                <br>onion for more people). Just have about the same amount of each.</li>
            <li>Put a bit of oil in the pot and some butter (optional) then sweat the veggies. </li>
            <li>Make a little well in the middle of the pot and squeeze in 2 cloves of garlic (or mince 
                <br>the garlic, grate it on a micro plane. Whatever). Let it get fragrant (about a minute) 
                <br>then mix it in. </li>
            <li>Add about a teaspoon of dried thyme and mix in - I do more like a tablespoon and a half. </li>
            <li>When the veggies have softened add a few heaping tablespoons of flour (you can go as far as 
                <br>1/4 cup or 4tbsp). Mix it in so the flour soaks up all the moisture. </li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth, I added an extra cup because I used more veggies.</li>
            <li>Chicken - either used pre-cooked chicken, shred and dump it in now. Or add boneless skinless 
                <br>chicken thighs to the boiling broth and cook until almost all the way done 
                <br>(I think it’s about 25-30ish minutes). Then take ‘em out, shred ‘em, and add ‘em back to the soup. 
                <br>Reduce heat to a simmer. </li>
            <li>Season to taste (it won’t need much)</li>
        </ol>

        
        <h4>Dumplings</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a separate bowl, Combine 3/4 cup of flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, a teaspoon-ish of thyme, 
                <br>pinch of salt and pepper and mix. </li>
            <li>Mix in 1/2 cup of milk, don’t over mix. Just enough to absorb the milk into the flour. 
                <br>Go for a little thicker than pancake batter</li>
            <li>Use 2 spoons to drop spoonfuls of the dumpling batter into the simmering soup. I find using a smaller 
                <br>spoon is best because the dumplings puff up as they steam. Put the lid on the pot and let steam for 10 minutes</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Let's Cook It!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 350°</li>
            <li>Dice the onions and sweat them with the meat as it browns.</li>
            <li>When the mat is browned and the onions are translucent, add garlic.</li>
            <li>Season with salt, pepper, cumin, and chili powder (about a half a table spoon each).</li>
            <li>(Optional) Add some chipotle sauce if you want it (you do)</li>
            <li>Heat the enchilada sauce and thicken with a corn starch slurry if necessary. (I really like to use a 
                <br><strong>Red Chile</strong> or <strong>Chile Colorado</strong> sauce here).</li>
            <li>Put a little sauce in the bottom of the baking dish. Fill tortillas with sauce meat and cheese, 
                <br>roll and place seam side down in dish. When finished, drizzle some more sauce on top, any extra 
                <br>meat and some cheese. </li>
            <li>Bake at 350°F until brown and bubbly good (~25-35 minutes).</li>
            <li>Chop up cilantro and put it on top</li>
            <li><em>LET IT REST</em>. It's hot and I don't want you burning your tongue</li>
            <li>Serve it up. I like to have mine with refired beans and brown rice 
                <br>(beacue brown rice tastes so much better)</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            It's a classic that we all know and love. Tender beef in a succulent gravy with onions, carrots, and potatoes. 
            Serve it with whatever sides you like but make sure to share it with friends and family. And tomorrow, you can 
            make an open faced sandwich with the leftovers! ðŸ¤¤
            <br>
            It takes a little time but is otherwise super simple to make. Sear the meat, soften the onions, add aromatics, 
            add the meat back to the pot, let it sit in the oven a while, add the potatoes and carrot then eat.

        <h3>Let's Cook It!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the meat generously with salt and pepper. Ideally let it sit over night or even 
                <br>longer to soak up the seasoning. Sear the meat on all sides in the Dutch oven on high heat 
                <br>(about 6 minutes a side)</li>
            <li>Dice a larger yellow onion (or 2 little ones) and soften in the same Dutch oven at medium-low heat. 
                <br>When nearly translucent add the thyme and sage to give an extra herb-y goodness to the gravy.</br>
            </li>
            <li>Once the onions are translucent, clear a space in the middle of the pot to add the garlic (either 
                <br>finely chopped or use a garlic press) and let it get fragrant (about a minute) then mix in. Sprinkle 
                <br>2 tblspns of flower and mix in then slowly add beef stock stirring the whole time</li>
            <li>Put the beef in the pot, add more beef stock if necessary, add a couple bay leaves and a dash of 
                <br>Worcestershire. Cover and let braise in a 300Â° oven for ~3.5 hour. Add whatever veggies you like 
                <br>for the last hour and a half (potatoes, carrots, celery, etc.)</li>
            <li>Pull it out of the oven when itâ€™s as tender as you want it (I like it to be not quite fall apart fork tender yet), 
                <br>hit the meat with some fresh cracked pepper, and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes.
        </ol>
        <p>
            <strong><em>This is where reasonable people may disagree</em>.</strong>
            <br>You can rest the meat in the cooking liquid and serve directly with your favorite sides. Or you can take everything out, 
            rest separately and thicken the gravy (if necessary).
        </p>
        <h4>If you coose to pull everything and thicken:</h4>
            <ol id="optional-steps">
                <li>Fish out the veggies with a spider strainer</li>
                <li>Put the Dutch over uncovered back on the stove on high heat and boil the shit out of the gravy until it 
                    <br>reaches desired thickness. (On occasion, Iâ€™ve actually had to add more broth because it had reduced 
                    <br>too much or maybe the roast wasnâ€™t as juicy). </li>
                <li>Slice and serve.</li>
                <li>You can also make broccoli and rice for extra sides</li>
            </ol>

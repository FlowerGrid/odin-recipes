# odin-recipes
A website to display a few recipes. From the odin project

### The Project
The project is to create a simple website that has an index (home) page, and
at least 3 recipe pages. 

### The Method
The index page will be a simple directory to each of the recipes.<br>
Each recipe page will have an a navigation bar of links (so far just back 
to the home page), an image of the dish, ingredients list, a brief 
description of the dish, and finally instructions on how to cook it
